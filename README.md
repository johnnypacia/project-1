Description of your website: 

'Simon Strums' is a call-and-response game where the object is to match notes that are randomly selected by the computer. When the computer selects a note, the color-box corresponding to that note quickly flashes an image. The user then needs to select the same note in order to win and move on to the next round. For each round, the computer will add another note to the sequence and the user needs to match that sequence exactly in order to continue playing the game. When the user fails to match the computer's sequence of notes, the game is over.
