User Story: 

-When page loads User sees the board with 4 colors-boxes, a start button, and a score counter set at 0

-When user presses start, computer randomly selects one of the boxes, flashes an image, and plays the corresponding custom-built sound clip for the selected box.

-User can then click on any color-box and in doing so flash the image and play the corresponding sound clip. 

-If the box clicked matches the box the computer randomly illuminated, user moves on to next round and score increases by 1.

-If the box clicked does not match, user is instructed to play again. 

-If player moves on to next round [round 2], computer should light up two boxes in sequence

-If player matches, move on to round 3, where the computer lights up 3 boxes in sequence

-With each round, computer adds and additional box to its sequence of illumination, so in round 10, computer will light up 10 boxes in sequence (each box illuminated for less than half a second)

-score counter keeps track of how many rounds player has completed
